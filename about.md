Hi! My name is Zewei Zhang. I recently graduated from Stony Brook university with the degree of Bachelor of science. I am currently looking for full-time software engineer positions.

I worked for CS department at Stony Brook University as a web developer since September 2015. My job responsibility was mainly maintaining and upgrading department websites including both front-end content and the backend database. I completed many projects from scratch with my colleagues, which require skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP and MySQL. Besides, I was a TA for a Java Introduction class in 2015. 

During my academic year, I did excellent jobs on course projects. I am sufficient in Java and C programming after finished many corresponding projects such as an e-Book lending system (J2EE and Database), Nachos (Java simulated operating system) and chat room (network programming in C). I am also very self-motivated to learn the most up-to-date framework such as AngularJS. 

I also placed my resume here. Click to open and preview.
