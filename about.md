Hi, I am Zewei Zhang. You can also call me Joey. I am currently studying at Stony Book University as computer science major, and specialize on software engineer. 

I have done many projects in my academic career including game, java EE application, network programming and operating system. 

I am working for computer science department at Stony Brook University as a web developer. Therefore I am also sufficient in web programming skills from the front end to the back end. 

Out of my major, I love anything about music. I like to play guitar, cover my favorite songs, and sometimes make my own music. I once performed on a TV show, and that [vedio][vedio] has more than 40 million hit on the internet in China. 

I also placed my resume and music blog here. Click to open or preview.
