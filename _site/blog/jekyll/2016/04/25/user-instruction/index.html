			<p>You might think that changing guitar strings is an “impossible mission”, however, it is really not that complicated as you thought. As a guitarist, you should learn to change your guitar strings sooner or later, since you will need this skill when you buy a new guitar without strings on it or when strings are broken. Therefore, this guideline is going to teach you how to change acoustic guitar strings.</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Required tools:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>A pack of new strings (Must be fit for acoustic guitars, instead of classic guitars or electric guitars).</li>
  <li>A guitar</li>
  <li>A scissor</li>
  <li>Guitar tuner (Tuning apps also work)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Suggested tools:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>String cutter</li>
  <li>String winder (Usually with a cut-out on the back)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="part-1-remove-old-strings">Part 1: Remove Old Strings</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Loosen all of the strings.  Counter-clockwisely wind the peg until you feel no more tension on the string (A suggested tool when you are doing this part is a string winder, which is easy to find in any music store).</li>
  <li>Use the scissor or string cutter to cut strings off. It does not matter where you cut them.
Take all of the strings off the headstock. When you unwind strings from pegs, be careful to prevent them to fly often hitting you in the face.</li>
  <li>Remove all the bridge pins out. These pins are located on another end of strings to hook them onto inside of the guitar. You can remove them either by hand, or by suggested helping tools such as pin puller (Some string winder has a cut-out on the back, which fits underneath the pin and enables you to pull the pin out straight away). Once pins are out, just pull out the rest of strings.</li>
  <li>Clean your finger board. It is not a necessary procedure, but most of you might find that the neck gets quite dirty, especially if you not change strings often. Find a proper cleaner on guitar store if possible. Do not use excess amount of water or any other common household cleaners, which could damage your fingerboard easily. If you do not have any cleaner with you, a slightly dampened cotton cloth is suggested.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="part-2-change-new-strings">Part 2: Change New Strings</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Prepare your new strings ready. Make sure the correct order of the new strings. Usually, strings are with different color of ball ends. If you look at the back in the pack, it will tell you what color corresponds to which peg hole.</li>
  <li>Insert the ball-end of the string into peg hole, then put the pin back into the hole. Put pressure down on the pin with your thumb, and pull the string through until you feel a nice and positive connection there.</li>
  <li>Stretch each string. You can lean the guitar against your leg with the fingerboard upward to get easier access to each turning key. Get the string ready, and adjust the hole on the tuning peg pointing up away from guitar. Fade the string through the hole, then grab the string and pull some slack through about five centimeters.</li>
  <li>Wrap the string around the top of the peg, and hold close onto the guitar. Your first finger should press the string down on the neck, and use your second finger keep a little bit of tension on the string. Next you can start to wind the peg until you feel a solid tension on the string. Make sure that the live part of string is going underneath the dead part. When you have completed this part, cut the rest dead part of string but leave about one centimeter. Bend that one centimeter part about 90 degree to make it look neat.</li>
  <li>Repeat above steps in part 2 for the rest of five strings.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="part-3-tuning-your-guitar">Part 3: Tuning your guitar</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You can use any tuning tool to proceed this part. However, I am going to introduce you a tuning app called “guitar tuna”, which is easy and free to operate for beginners.
Download “guitar tuna” in app store.</li>
  <li>Set up the environment. A quiet space is required for this step. Put your phone on a table and make sure that the microphone on your phone are facing you. You can sit down in front of the table with your guitar.</li>
  <li>Choose the string that you are going to tune. For example, let us start from string E. Tap the letter “E” in the app. Now you can try to pick the E string, meanwhile, look at the pointer in the tuning interface. If the pointer is left to the middle red line, clockwisely wind the corresponding peg. If the pointer is right to the middle red line, counter-clockwisely wind the corresponding peg. Repeat this step until the pointer exactly points to the middle and a green check-off sign shows up,  which means this string is correctly tuned.</li>
  <li>Repeat step 3 for the rest of the strings.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="congratulations">Congratulations!</h2>
<p>Enjoy to play your guitar with new strings.</p>
