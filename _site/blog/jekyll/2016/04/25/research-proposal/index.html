			<p>Artificial Intelligence has been a hot-debated topic for years since this concept came up. During past decades, it not only made a huge progress on scientific field, but also provided loads of resources for literature works. Literature works are a kind of reflection of the actual scientific progress on AI more or less. Some of them displayed a positive prospect of the human future with the help of AI, while others are more prefer the opinion that human being will be destroyed by ultimate AI eventually. Especially recently, the chess competition between “Alphago” which is an AI developed by google and Lee Seldo who is the one of the best chess player once more impressed the world that how AI made a huge progress these years. However, we have to go back to the actual science rather than simply literature work if we want to do some serious research. This study will employ research to identify the potential threat of AI to human being, and available approaches to balance the AI ethics and the potential huge power behind it.</p>

<p>Many researches about potential threat that human will confront when the AI became stronger have been done. In the research “AI Ethics: Science Fiction Meets Technological Reality” (Daniel Zeng), it summarized from a great amount of work contributed by scientists and also researcher in philosophy and literature. He concluded that an almost mature AI system were established, nevertheless, there are still six major threads. More specifically, in terms of the technique itself, it is hard to control the growth of AI once it starts to build itself increasingly powerful. Besides, the development of AI will bring a series of social problem. For example, the growth of AI in manufactory will decrease the job opportunity for humans, and the increasing use of robots as weapon to against humans. Moreover, current human legal system is hard to apply to AI as well as the human value. A very famous case is whether a driverless car should protect its passengers or the people outside the car when emergency happens. Similar research are also found in “Rise of Concerns about AI: Reflections and Directions” (Thomas G.Dietterich and Eric J. Horvitz). Excluded the thread that we discussed before, this research also talked about the bug and cybersecurity issue of AI. These threads are common in any software engineer field. The requirement of precise algorithm of AI need to be same or even higher than the spacecraft system. More than that, there are still lots of unpredictable situation that hard to be handled. The AI algorithm is also as vulnerable as any other normal program. 
To solve those problems, scientists also did some research to find out way to reduce the thread and balance the relationship between AI and human being. In research “Safety Engineering for Artificial General Intelligence” (Roman Yampolskiy and Joshua Fox), instead of trying to limit the power of AI or make more complex algorithm to control AI like most research did, the author proposed a new science of safety engineering for intelligent artificial agents based on maximizing the human value, since they believe that no such algorithm can handle all the complex and unpredictable situations. They believe that safety engineer is the new branch of AI study that can prevent AI to change themselves more against human, and provide more safe research environment on AI study.</p>

<p>From what we know so far, the potential risk of AI is majorly about the technique itself and the negative social influence. For techniques, I would study more deeply on the potential bugs and what coding convention and data structure could better avoid those potential error during developing an AI. Meanwhile, I will combine my study with the cybersecurity, since most malicious attack use the safety flaw which could be caused by any bugs from program. Besides, the safety engineer is a very interesting topic that I want to focus on, in order to  discover the approaches to enhance the safety of research and combine the human value to the study of the AI development. I believe if I discover more deeply based on most common techniques such as class algorithms to control AI, and meantime discover more on the new ideas such as safety engineer, it will make me get twice the result with half the effort. Also, the research such as “AI Ethics: Science Fiction Meets Technological Reality” (Daniel Zeng) lacks of specific data to support its argument when it talks about the decreasing employment in human world. I will collect more accurate data and display them in my research in a clear format such as table or graph.</p>

<p>To achieve the research goals, I will mainly use internet to look for the source I need. The local news and documentation that records the trend of employment and the automation of local factory will be a good resource to study the economic effects that AI caused. Since I am a software engineer student,  I need at least one group mate who has background on machine learning to compensate my lack of computer engineer knowledge. We will find more research about the algorithms design as our main line, and also study the code to implement the algorithm. I will take the responsibility of software part while my partner will focus on the machine language. Last but not least, we still need to read more about the safety engineer, since it is a new area and lots of concepts behind this theory is very new and worthy to learn more. I plan to take one semester and ten to fifteen hours each week to study on this topic coordinate with my group mate.</p>

<p>To sum up, my research will ends up providing more accurate data about how AI affects human being. As we are not experts on this fields, we might will not contributes too much on the current work for now, however, we at least will implement couple of classic AI algorithm model, and the common bugs that developer will easily make when they are new to this field. This is a good resource to the future researcher who is as new as me to study this field. Therefore, I believe my research will eventually give a good example to those people who have related background and interested to start the study on AI safety and ethics, and lay the foundation for the future research on AI topic.</p>
