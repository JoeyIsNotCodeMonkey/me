	  				<p>Artificial Intelligence has been a hot-debated topic for years since this concept came up. During past decades, it not only made a huge progress on scientific field, but also provided loads of resources for literature works. Literature works are a kind of reflection of the actual scientific progress on AI more or less. Some of them displayed a positive prospect of the human future with the help of AI, while others are more prefer the opinion that human being will be destroyed by ultimate AI eventually. Especially recently, the chess competition between “Alphago” which is an AI developed by google and Lee Seldo who is the one of the best chess player once more impressed the world that how AI made a huge progress these years. However, we have to go back to the actual science rather than simply literature work if we want to do some serious research. This study will employ research to identify the potential threat of AI to human being, and available approaches to balance the AI ethics and the potential huge power behind it.</p>

	  				<p>The artificial intelligence is a hot-debated topic since this concept was came up decades ago. Not only the scientific progress that this field has approached during the past decades, but also a bunch of the great literatures such as movies and fictions published. Humans always dedicate for the power of the AI, while there are so many unsure and dangerous elements in this field, which made people are also fear about the power behind it. Recently, a very hot news brought our sights back to the artificial intelligence, which is the chess game held between the “Alphago” and Lee Seldo, who are the AI invented by google and one of the best human chess player in the world responsively. Alphago ended up won this game by a huge margin. This was a good opportunity to show how big progress scientists have achieved during past years, but at same time, there are lots of questioning voices raised up. Some people are more concerned about the safety of human future for their worries like one day artificial intelligence overpassed the power of human. So in this literature review, I am going to focus on the study of how to balance the AI ethics and the huge power behind it, and the results of related researches.</p>

	  				<p>You might think that changing guitar strings is an “impossible mission”, however, it is really not that complicated as you thought. As a guitarist, you should learn to change your guitar strings sooner or later, since you will need this skill when you buy a new guitar without strings on it or when strings are broken. Therefore, this guideline is going to teach you how to change acoustic guitar strings.</p>
