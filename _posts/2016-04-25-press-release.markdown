## Stony Brook is going to implement a tobacco-free policy on January 1, 2016, which includes all tobacco and smoke/vapor-producing products.

Stony Brook University decided to publish a new tobacco-free policy based on the resolution in 2012 expressing “support of a tobacco-free SUNY policy and the enactment of legislation that bans the use of tobacco on grounds and facilities, and in vehicles owned, leased or controlled by the State University or its related entities.” In fact, SUNY state university have been working on the implementation of their own policy, and we are glad to announce that Stony Brook University eventually trod this important step. The tobacco-free policy will officially start in January 1, 2016.

It is a known fact that tobacco smoking has many disadvantages. A lot of research reported that tobacco can potentially cause many health problems such as lung cancer. Moreover, the secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart attack and other heart problems. Besides, it is a large cost for school to clean and repair the damages caused by the use of tobacco. Banning the use of tobacco will effectively reduce the cost on these maintaining work, while spend these savings in more meaningful ways. For your own sake, quit smoking will effectively improve your health status, and save more than $3,500 a year. Stony Brook Univeristy used to offer smokers certain indoor and outdoor areas for quite a long time. These places are no longer available for smoking once the tobacco-free policy starts. Smoking will be a hundred percent forbidden in Stony Brook campus area. 

Banning the use of tobacco is not intended to force student stop smoking in campus or using tobacco outside of campus. Our original intention was to help students learn how to reduce the use of tobacco. Besides, it is respection to the people who have the rights to refuse the secondhand smoke. We realized that quitting smoking is a quite difficult long term task, since most addicted smokers complain that smoking is so hard to get rid of. Therefore, Stony Brook University will offer tobacco use cessation assistance for severely addicted smokers. You can find help in Student Health Service, “Healthier U” and Employee Health Service at Stony Brook University Hospital. The Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Health Education Office is hosting weekly workshops to learn how to be tobacco free, Tuesdays from 1:00 pm to 1:53 pm, beginning November 24, 2015. Registration is required. It also provides a 24-hour access hotline or anyone needing assistance including smoking cessation. Besides, you can also join our learn to be tobacco-free smoking cessation program at Stony Brook Education Center.

We believe that tobacco-free policy will return a more clean and healthy study environment to students. All members in Stony Brook University must follow the principle that tobacco use is not accepted at Stony Brook University.
