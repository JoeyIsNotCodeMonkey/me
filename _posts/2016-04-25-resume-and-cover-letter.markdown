Dear Hiring Manager:

I am writing in response to your hiring information on Handshake for Software Engineer. I would like to apply as lead web developer in your company. As a current web developer at Stony Brook University, I am confident to say that I have many abilities to work with your company.

I am currently an undergraduate student at Stony Brook University and will be graduating this Nov with a B.S. in computer science. I started to work for Stony Brook University CS department as a web developer since last September. During that time, I was mainly responsible for the maintenance and upgrades of the CS department website. I also completed some projects from scratch with my colleagues, which require skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL. There are couple of projects that came from my current work listed on my personal webpage. I am also sufficient in Java and C programming. I completed a online auction house project which strongly related to Java and database skills. I also wrote a multithreaded chat room in C programming language, which helped me build a strong networking background and coding ability. 

At this stage, I engage to work for a company like yours that provides great opportunities to undergraduate students and facilitates them to develop and build on their existing skills. I have enclosed my resume for your review. I would welcome the further discussion with you in greater detail, and look forward to your response. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,

ZHANG ZEWEI
