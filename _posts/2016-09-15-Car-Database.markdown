I wrote this independent project in order to learn Ajax, PHP and MySQL. 

This is a web application, in which users are able to search, add, update and delete any car information. The coolest thing about this Web App is that everything displayed asynchronously by using Ajax. 

Here is some screenshots to demestrate main functions:

### Search
![search]({{site.baseurl}}/cars_database/search.png)

### Add
![add]({{site.baseurl}}/cars_database/add.png)

### Update
![add]({{site.baseurl}}/cars_database/add.png)

### Delete
![delete]({{site.baseurl}}/cars_database/delete.png)

I have done similar projects before such as e-Book Lending System, which I implemented it using jsp. Compare to the confusing jsp, jpa, servlet and Spring framework, I definitely fell in love with PHP. It is so simple to read and write, and so efficent work with MySQL. In general, I just need to pass whatever element that needs to be handled from html page to php pages, and then use mysqli to filter the data out of database and put it back to html page. 

This is a very tiny PHP project, I believe that I will build more complicated web application in the future using PHP, because I love this incredible language soooo much!
