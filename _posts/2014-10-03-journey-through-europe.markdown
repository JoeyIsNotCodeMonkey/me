description: A Strategic card board game

This is a strategic card board game (All about rolling dies and take steps...) programmed using Java. 

I completed this project when I am taking the advanced Java class in Stony Brook University back to 2 years ago. This class is not only teaching the programming skills in Java, but more focus on the code design, test and debug. 

This image displays that how do my file structure look like:
![file_structure]({{site.baseurl}}/cse219/file_structure.png)

Since this game needs very much art work such as images for map and cards, as well as the game records, I made a fileloader file to handle all the request related to loading files. All of the data type was created inside game package. Last but not least, UI and all the events handlers are located at UI packages. 

Since this project had a time limit of only one month to complete, students were not required to implement all the scenerio for each card. Whoever finish the travel first win the game. Players have option to choose their enemy to be either human or AI. 

Here are some screen shots for the game:

### Selecting Number of Players
![choose]({{site.baseurl}}/cse219/choose.png)

### Playing Game
![game]({{site.baseurl}}/cse219/game.png)

As you can see, the UI is very poor since I took too many classes that semester. I usually will not leave my projects with a bad looking, but this is one of the exception due to my overloaded schedule. 

This projects enhanced my Java programming skill to level 8 out of 10. I had so much fun when I was doing it.
